After taking the code in your local machine, Make sure you have node.js, npm, angular installed.


1) run command line as administrator and navigate to the project folder
2) Run "npm install" command in order to download node_modules folder.
3) run "ng serve". This will run a local server on your machine.

Then go to http://localhost:4200. This is the default port of your application.
